| Add translation button to main page.                                                                                                                                              | Complete. |                                                                           |
| Add a way for public users to EDIT cultural assets                                                                                                                                |           | Perhaps add a field in survey that notes whether this is an edited asset. |
| On base map, make main streets slightly wider. Some intersections look a bit strange when zoomed in.                                                                              |           |                                                                           |
| On the full-screen version, create custom large pop-ups or shadowboxes that display images in large format.                                                                       |           |                                                                           |
| Add an icon type for evenly mixed clusters.                                                                                                                                       |           |                                                                           |
| Change icons on map to match subcategory types, as opposed to attempting to symbolizing categories with a single icon. (Doesn't work great for creative industries, for example.) |           |                                                                           |
| Perhaps add a question to survey that registers concern about the potential loss of an asset.                                                                                     |           |                                                                           |
| Add a zoning underlay                                                                                                                                                             |           |                                                                           |
| Documentation for how to change/add asset categories                                                                                                                              |           |                                                                           |
|                                                                                                                                                                                   |           |                                                                           |
