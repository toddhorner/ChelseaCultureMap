## Working todo list

- Change icons on map to match subcategory types, as opposed to attempting to symbolizing categories with a single icon. (Doesn't work great for creative industries, for example.)
- Add an icon type for evenly mixed clusters.
- On main page, make a gallery of walking tours, which link to ArcGIS story maps.
- On main page, link to a full-screen version of the map currently displayed at the top of the page.
  - On the full-screen version, create custom large pop-ups or shadowboxes that display images in large format.
- On base map, make main streets slightly wider. Some intersections look a bit strange when zoomed in.
- Add translation button to main page.
